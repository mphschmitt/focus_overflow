# focus_overflow
A "toy" chrome extension to stop losing time on stack overlow and get some job done.

## What
This extension removes the "hot network questions" from stack overflow and all stackexchange.  
It is very simple, and does not do anything else.
There are very good extensions that enable user to delete specific elements from any html page, like adBlock.
